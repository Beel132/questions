# Project

It's a project that questions things about you (name, years old and hair color), and in the end, shows you everything you have writed.

### Logic

I used conditional statement (if & else) in basically "everything" in this project, and variables to save user's data. <br>
i believe i could use **a lot** less lines of code, but i'm proud of the final result.

### "Journey"

I made this project in 2 days (i'm not this good at logic), but i finally made it! <br>
sorry, i know this is a bit basic

but **thank you** for your time :)
